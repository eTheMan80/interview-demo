## TODO list

- I couldn't test the post and delete calls to the api because I didn't have access
- I have added some brief tests, I would definitely add more tests depending on how the component is built when finished
- Use own built components instead of Material UI depending on the project requirements
- Add better styling to the page to improve the UI and UX
- Find a better to use forms on the page
